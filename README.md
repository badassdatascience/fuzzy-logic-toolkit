===================

A toolkit for fuzzy logic reasoning written in C++.

A blog post describing how the application works is available at (http://badassdatascience.com/2014/11/22/fuzzy-logic-toolkit-cpp/).

To compile the example code, main.cc, simply run "make". After the build is complete you can run the example by running "./main". You can then remove the extra build files by running "make clean".
